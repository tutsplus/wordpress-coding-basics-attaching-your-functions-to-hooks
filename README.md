# [WordPress Coding Basics: Attaching Your Functions to Hooks][published url]
## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]

When you write a function in a plugin or your theme's functions file, how do you get it to run? Hooks, that's how! Hooks let you write clean and easy-to-maintain themes and plugins, and also let you modify the behaviour of third-party themes and plugins.

In this course you'll learn how to attach functions to action and filter hooks, and when to choose each type. I'll show you how to attach your function to an action hook to run when a specific event occurs, and how to write a filter function to modify site content on the fly.

## Source Files Description:

This repository contains the final version of the theme created during the course, along with some hooks and functions.
